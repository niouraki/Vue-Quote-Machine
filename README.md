# Quotes Project
This is a small project created so I can have more practice with Vue.js
When the user clicks the button a random quote appears on the screen and the background color changes.
The styling is minimal, I just focused on the functionality and the use of Vue.

The quotes are from RapidAPI (https://rapidapi.com/) Random Famous Quotes (https://rapidapi.com/andruxnet/api/random-famous-quotes). It is free and it doesn't require cors.
